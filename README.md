# Work-Day-Scheduler
Purpose of the work day schedule is for users to easily create, modify, and save organized tasks throughout their work day. When user loads the page, the work day schedule will display current day and date, and saved tasks throughout a normal scheduled work day 9AM-5PM.  

## modified changes
The first change I made was to create a function that allows the user to save tasks on the page. I then created a four loop to iterate over the row elements on the page to save enteries into local storage using 'getItem' method. When users click the saved button, data is saved used the 'setItem' method.
